## Usage guidelines

- **Submit buttons**: Unlike the native button element, `type="submit"` must be specified on Button for it to act as a submit button.
- **Links**: The Button component enforces button semantics (`role="button"`, keyboard interaction, disabled state). It should not be used for links. See [Rendering links as buttons](#rendering-links-as-buttons) below.

## Anatomy

Import the component:

```jsx title="Anatomy"
import { Button } from '@base-ui/react/button';

<Button />;
```

## Examples

### Rendering as another tag

The button can remain keyboard accessible while being rendered as another tag, such as a `<div>`, by specifying `nativeButton={false}`.

```jsx title="Custom tag button" "nativeButton"
import { Button } from '@base-ui/react/button';

<Button render={<div />} nativeButton={false}>
  Button that can contain complex children
</Button>;
```

### Rendering links as buttons

The Button component enforces button semantics. `nativeButton={false}` signals that the rendered tag is not a `<button>`, but it must still be a tag that can receive button semantics (`role="button"`, keyboard interaction handlers). Links (`<a>`) have their own semantics and should not be rendered as buttons through the `render` prop.

If a link needs to look like a button visually, style the `<a>` element directly with CSS rather than using the Button component.

### Loading states

For buttons that enter a loading state after being clicked, specify the `focusableWhenDisabled` prop to ensure focus remains on the button when it becomes disabled. This prevents focus from being lost and maintains the tab order.

import { DemoButtonLoading } from './demos/loading';
