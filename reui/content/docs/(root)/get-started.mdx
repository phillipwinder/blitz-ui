This guide walks you through the essential steps to seamlessly integrate ReUI into your shadcn project.

## Prerequisites

ReUI is built on the latest **React 19** and [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com). Ensure your project is set up with these technologies before proceeding.
We recommend following the [Official shadcn/ui Installation Guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) to prepare your environment.

## Setup ReUI Registry

Add the ReUI registry namespace to your `components.json`. Learn more about registry config from [shadcn registry docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry).

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@reui": "https://reui.io/r/{style}/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

## Components & Patterns

You can integrate ReUI components & patterns using the [**shadcn CLI**](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) for automation or by manual installation for full control.
Both methods support our entire collection of [Components](/docs/) and [Patterns](/patterns).

## Styling

ReUI extends the official shadcn/ui theming system with additional semantic tokens that enable precise, context-aware UI states:

- `--destructive-foreground`: Used for high-contrast destructive actions and error states.
- `--info` & `--info-foreground`: Semantic colors for informational alerts and badges.
- `--success` & `--success-foreground`: Semantic colors for success indicators and positive states.
- `--warning` & `--warning-foreground`: Semantic colors for cautionary callouts and warnings.
- `--invert` & `--invert-foreground`: Semantic colors for inverse states.

This setup our custom color tokens, see the [Styling Guide](/docs/styling).

## Base UI and Radix UI Support

We understand that different projects have different needs. ReUI is built to be primitive-agnostic, offering both [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com)
versions for each entry in our registry. This allows you to maintain consistency while choosing the library that best fits your technical requirements.

## AI-Enhanced Workflow

ReUI is designed from the ground up to be **AI-friendly**, making it easier for language models to understand and modify your UI.

- **llms.txt**: Access our [llms.txt](/llms.txt) file for a structured map of our documentation and architecture optimized for AI agents.
- **Copy Markdown**: Every page includes a **Copy Markdown** feature, allowing you to instantly feed documentation or code into your AI-driven development workflows.
