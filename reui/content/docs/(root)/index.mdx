ReUI is a first class shadcn registry offering a collection of open source components, patterns, and blocks built
for shadcn and compatible with [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Designed for developers and AI.

## Vision

With over 15 years of experience in UI/UX design and full-stack app development for startups and enterprises, we understand how to build interfaces that are both
visually refined and highly functional for developers and AI driven workflows. We believe great UI should be intuitive to use, easy to understand, and simple to maintain at scale.

## Approach

ReUI organizes your shadcn projects into [Patterns](/patterns) providing a flexible foundation to build at the right level of abstraction.
This approach gives you the flexibility to choose the right level of abstraction for your shadcn projects.

## Foundation

ReUI offers two versions of each component, pattern, and block for both [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com)
versions to cover existing and new projects requirements.
