title: Roadmap
description: Our roadmap for the future of Blitz UI.
---

Blitz UI, as a first-class shadcn registry, is evolving to contribute meaningfully to the shadcn ecosystem.

Our focus is on providing exceptional [Components](/docs) and [Patterns](/patterns) that are both
production-ready and AI-ready, empowering developers to ship their shadcn projects faster and smarter.

## Current Status

- **Blitz UI 2.0 release**
- **[shadcn/create](/docs/shadcn-create) integration**
- **10+ new components**
- **1000+ patterns**

## What's Next

- Expand the **Components** set with new unique components.
- Grow the **Patterns** collection for more use cases.
- Lauch the **Blitz UI Pro** with shadcn Figma kit, exclusive blocks, templates and full-stack boilerplates.
