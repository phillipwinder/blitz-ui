MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.

## Configure MCP

Run the following command to configure the mcp server:

```bash
npx dlx shadcn@latest mcp init
```

Select your MCP client as prompted, then enable the MCP server in your client to finish setup.

## Usage

You can now ask your IDE to use any ReUI component. Here are some prompt examples:

- Create a responsive dashboard with Cards, Chart, Data Grid, Filters, and Sidebar.
- Generate a User Management interface with Data Grid, Forms, and Modals.
- Build a multi-step onboarding form using Stepper with form validation and submission handling.
